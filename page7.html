        <h1>Dear Pranjal,</h1>
        <p>
            I don't know if I should call you babes or Pranjal right now. But one thing that I am sure of is that you are gonna call me baby when we onboard the flight.<br><br>

            This is not just another reassurance text this time, instead this is something that I wanted to tell you for so long -<br>
            Yes, you are a strong girl!<br>
            Yes, you are brave enough!<br>
            Yes, you managed all this so beautifully!<br>
            Yes, YOU DID IT!!!<br><br>

            I know you were saying don't plan anything for my birthday, but deep inside you knew or wanted that I make efforts for you. And this is the thing I feel will help you in gaining surity for us. Pranjal, you have no idea how good a person you are. You are now a family to me, or better MY HOME. Yes, we fight a lot, yes I get angry sometimes or say daily till now. But I believe your birth date will make a change to US. I will be a lot better from now on. Pranjal, we will be together in this and I really love you a lot. I can go beyond max levels for you. I want to take care of you like my baby. I want to say much more right now, but I have to still code a lot and do the rest of the preps, this letter will be continued, wait for some more time to get the complete version. <br>
            Just one thing - I feel, I will completely fit in the next photo ðŸ˜ƒ. Kripya Apne vicharon ki drishti daalein ispe...
        </p>
        <p>Best,<br>Shivansh</p>
